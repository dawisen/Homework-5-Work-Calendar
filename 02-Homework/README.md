# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Your Task

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. 
This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

```
    use daily planner to create a schedule
- WHEN I open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar (using moment.js)

- WHEN I scroll down I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours (TABLE 9am-5pm)

- WHEN I view the time blocks for that day each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (RED), present(GREEN), or future (GRAY)

- WHEN I click into a time block I can enter an event

- WHEN I click the save button for that time block the text for that event is saved in local storage

- WHEN I refresh the page the saved events persist (in local storage)
