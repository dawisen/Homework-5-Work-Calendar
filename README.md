## Description
This project utilizes Moment.js and local storage allowing users to save work tasks in their browser window. When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar. As you scroll down you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm). The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present(red), or future (green). The saved events persist in local storage when you refresh the page
