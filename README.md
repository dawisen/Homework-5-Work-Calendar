- When you open the planner the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar using moment.js

- WHEN you scroll down you are presented with time blocks for standard business hours (9am-5pm)

-The time blocks are color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past (gray), present(red), or future (green)

- When you click on a time block you can enter an event

- You can click the save button for that time block to save your memo in local storage

- The saved events persist in local storage when you refresh the page
